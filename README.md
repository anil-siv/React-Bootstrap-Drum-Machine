# React-Bootstrap-Drum-Machine

FreeCodeCamp Project to build a drum machine, tests are working but I'm not overly happy with the code as lacking DRY. 

Going to try to learn more about the .map() in react to have one Component class that renders all 9 buttons.

Edited to include .map - the trick was using a functional component and then calling it into the main app and passing props.
